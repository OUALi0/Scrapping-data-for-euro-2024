## Introduction

This project involves scraping data from [specific website or source] and analyzing it to extract meaningful insights. The goal is to [briefly describe the goal of the analysis].

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained by scraping [specific website or source]. It includes features such as [list some key features].

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
   cd project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Load the provided notebooks in the following order:
   - `1 - Data Scraping.ipynb`
   - `2 - Data Analysis.ipynb`

3. Run the cells sequentially to perform the data scraping and analysis.

## Steps

### Data Scraping

1. **Setup**: Import necessary libraries and set up configurations.
2. **Fetching Data**: Use the Requests library to fetch data from [specific website or source].
3. **Parsing Data**: Use BeautifulSoup4 to parse the HTML content and extract relevant information.
4. **Storing Data**: Store the extracted data in a structured format using Pandas.

### Data Analysis

1. **Loading the Dataset**: Load the scraped dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and perform any necessary data transformations.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generate various plots to visualize the data.
   - Distribution of [key feature]
   - Relationships between [key features]
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if needed.
5. **Answering Specific Questions**: Perform targeted analyses to answer specific questions related to your topic.

## Results

- **Key Insight 1**: Describe the first key insight from the analysis.
- **Key Insight 2**: Describe the second key insight from the analysis.
- **Additional Insights**: List any additional insights or findings.
